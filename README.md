# Adaptive control of  polymicrobial infectious communities with reinforcement learning

In the context of polymicrobial urinary tract infections (UTIs),

- How do ecological interactions between pathogenic species impact the effectiveness of a drug policy?
- If there is an impact, then how do we adapt our drug policy according to various ecological contexts? and Can the reinforcement learning approach enable adaptive drug control?

# Implementation

Parameters from (de Vos *et al.*, 2017): folder `params_deVos2017`

Qualitative analyses on 2-species model - different regimes of species abundance for varying inter-species interaction strengths: run `python qualitative_analyses.py` (or Jupyter Notebook `qualitative_analyses.ipynb`)
